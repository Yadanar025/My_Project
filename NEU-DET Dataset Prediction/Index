This project implements deep learning models for defect classification on the NEU-DET dataset from Kaggle using TensorFlow.
Dataset: The NEU-DET dataset contains grayscale images of six different types of surface defects found in steel strips.
Classes:Crazing, Inclusion, Patches, Pitted Surface, Rolled-in Scale, Scratches

Source: Kaggle – NEU Surface Defect Detection Dataset
